# Parandum

Language learning platform for schools, first developed for [Reading School](https://reading-school.co.uk).
This is an archive of the iteration submitted as my AQA A Level Computer Science Non-Examined Assessment; the production version is in the [main repo](https://github.com/mgrove36/parandum).
